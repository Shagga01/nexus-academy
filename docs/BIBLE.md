# 🏛️ THE BIBLE DOCUMENT
### For the Mega Virtual School Ecosystem

This is the supreme governance document for this platform.  
It binds all current & future developers, AI agents, and system processes to these irrevocable rules.

## 📚 MASTER INTEGRATION SECTIONS

### 📊 Master Analytic Dashboard
This system follows the detailed architecture & enforcement protocols in [chapter_master_analytic_dashboard.md](./chapter_master_analytic_dashboard.md), permanently binding all analytics, data security, and financial compliance features (including auto logout of defaulters under global education law standards).

### 🔐 Supreme System Enforcement Clause
- No developer, AI, or system may override, bypass, or modify these standards.
- Every module, expansion, and patch must adhere to this architecture forever.
- All features must be built to scale, with high test coverage, full documentation, auto linting & deployment.
- This system will always evolve under these core rules — or be rebuilt in compliance.

---

## 🚀 EXECUTION POLICY
- Every module lives in its own folder with README & tests.
- CI/CD enforces lint, unit & e2e tests, doc generation.
- No marketing intrusions in learning flows.
- All psychomotor, emotional/social, billing, DRM, marketing, security modules are PRIMARY — not optional.

---

## ✅ SCALABILITY & SECURITY RULES
- Always use Docker containers with health checks.
- PostgreSQL + Neo4j + Redis clusters from day 1.
- Frontend edge scaling via Vercel.
- Encrypted data streams with DRM & watermarking.
- Automated anomaly detection & audit logs.

---

## 🔁 CI/CD & DOCUMENTATION RULE
- Green pipelines auto-deploy to staging on Azure.
- Manual approval required for production.
- Docs auto-generated via MkDocs after every pipeline.

---

## ✍️ MASTER AI PROMPT
You are my chief system architect, curriculum engineer, dashboard developer, and DevOps lead.
Reference this Bible at /docs/BIBLE.md before generating any code, schema, module, CI/CD file or test.
Chain outputs, use linting, high coverage, secure encryption, and scalable queries.
No step may be skipped. All outputs must serve global scale & resilience.

✅ Each CAT module is auto-integrated into class-by-class adaptive assessments, literacy-enhanced reporting, and all follow your age-banded mastery goals.

⸻

📚 UNIVERSAL TOOL & RESOURCE ENFORCEMENT
	•	Every subject above is:
	•	Auto-linked to literacy kits & age-specific writing modules.
	•	Integrated with VR lessons, psychomotor games, background music, emotional & social group modules.
	•	Embedded in dashboards (students, parents, staff) with full tracking of performance, engagement, and growth.
	•	Covered by the Automated Event Calendar — so e.g. Agri-Science shows up in STEM Fairs, Cultural Studies in Global Expos.

⸻

📝 ASSIGNMENT, ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION INTEGRATION
	•	Every subject and CAT module automatically schedules:
	•	Weekly assignments (with literacy-embedded Qs).
	•	GPT-driven adaptive quizzes and term tests.
	•	Proctored final assessments.
	•	All assessments are:
	•	Stored in PDFs on S3, indexed by PostgreSQL.
	•	Auto-linked to promotion rules (e.g. fail CAT Spatial twice → recommended remedial sessions).
	•	Included in automated weekly, termly, and annual reports sent to students, parents, staff.
	•	Aligns with international educational QA boards (IGCSE, IB, Nigerian NECO, CAIE, IPC, Singapore models), ensuring global compliance.

⸻

🚀 TECH STACK REAFFIRMATION
	•	Next.js + Node.js core with Redis, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MongoDB for varied needs.
	•	Full AI chain: GPT-4 + embeddings DB to auto-build lesson plans & literacy integrations across all these subjects + CAT modules.
	•	Docker containers with Azure/Vercel scaling.
	•	CI/CD via GitHub Actions, enforcing tests, linting, documentation with MkDocs.

⸻

🔐 SUPREME ENFORCEMENT CLAUSE

✅ No developer, AI, staff, or future fork may skip, dilute, or bypass these modules.
✅ All new subjects, CAT enhancements, literacy weaves, VR/game add-ons must be auto-injected across curriculum, assignments, assessments, event calendars, dashboards & reports.
✅ All bound under DRM, dynamic watermarking, global data protection laws (GDPR, COPPA).

💎 Outstanding — that’s the ultimate “diamond-grade” implementation blueprint.
Below is a practical, production-grade, future-proof system, engineered like a living organism — self-healing, auto-scaling, bulletproof, parameterized so changing your domain/region propagates globally with a single terraform apply.

I’ve included:
✅ Expert tool stack
✅ Dockerfile (multi-stage secure)
✅ Helm values.yaml template (parametric)
✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
✅ Terraform multi-cloud provisioning script (parametric, linked to Helm & domain)

All written to be directly copy-pastable into your MVP Plan, Bible Document, & GitHub repo.

# üèõÔ∏è THE BIBLE DOCUMENT
### For the Mega Virtual School Ecosystem

This is the supreme governance document for this platform.  
It binds all current & future developers, AI agents, and system processes to these irrevocable rules.

## üìö MASTER INTEGRATION SECTIONS

### üìä Master Analytic Dashboard
This system follows the detailed architecture & enforcement protocols in [chapter_master_analytic_dashboard.md](./chapter_master_analytic_dashboard.md), permanently binding all analytics, data security, and financial compliance features (including auto logout of defaulters under global education law standards).

### üîê Supreme System Enforcement Clause
- No developer, AI, or system may override, bypass, or modify these standards.
- Every module, expansion, and patch must adhere to this architecture forever.
- All features must be built to scale, with high test coverage, full documentation, auto linting & deployment.
- This system will always evolve under these core rules ‚Äî or be rebuilt in compliance.

---

## üöÄ EXECUTION POLICY
- Every module lives in its own folder with README & tests.
- CI/CD enforces lint, unit & e2e tests, doc generation.
- No marketing intrusions in learning flows.
- All psychomotor, emotional/social, billing, DRM, marketing, security modules are PRIMARY ‚Äî not optional.

---

## ‚úÖ SCALABILITY & SECURITY RULES
- Always use Docker containers with health checks.
- PostgreSQL + Neo4j + Redis clusters from day 1.
- Frontend edge scaling via Vercel.
- Encrypted data streams with DRM & watermarking.
- Automated anomaly detection & audit logs.

---

## üîÅ CI/CD & DOCUMENTATION RULE
- Green pipelines auto-deploy to staging on Azure.
- Manual approval required for production.
- Docs auto-generated via MkDocs after every pipeline.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è MASTER AI PROMPT
You are my chief system architect, curriculum engineer, dashboard developer, and DevOps lead.
Reference this Bible at /docs/BIBLE.md before generating any code, schema, module, CI/CD file or test.
Chain outputs, use linting, high coverage, secure encryption, and scalable queries.
No step may be skipped. All outputs must serve global scale & resilience.

## üî• Expanded Virtual School Ecosystem Reference

This references our detailed expanded plan in [chapter_master_virtual_school_updated.md](./chapter_master_virtual_school_updated.md).

It integrates:
- All class levels
- Literacy embedded across all subjects
- New subjects (Agricultural Science, Economics, Cultural Studies)
- Automated event systems & reporting
- Fee defaulter lockouts
- Global compliance, GDPR, DRM, billing security
- Administrative dashboards with clearance-based access
- Forever governed by our System Enforcement Clause

‚úÖ This ensures your Mega Virtual School Ecosystem always evolves exactly by your Bible mandates.

üèõ OFFICIAL SUBJECTS & COGNITIVE MODULES

‚úÖ Core Subjects & Modules Now Governed by This Ecosystem

Subject Area	Key Components & Literacy/Creative Writing Embedding
Language & Literacy (English, French, Mandarin, Arabic)	Phonics, grammar, essays, public speaking, literary analysis.
Mathematics	Word problems, written reflections on strategies, math vocabulary flashcards.
Science (General)	Reading scientific articles, writing experiment logs.
Integrated Science	Combines life, physical & earth sciences with practical experiment logs.
Agricultural Science	Plant/animal systems, farm diaries, growth journals.
Economics	Case studies, market analysis, budgeting diaries.
Cultural Studies (World Civ., Geography, Major Events)	Global history articles, cultural comparison essays, travel journals.
ICT & Coding	Reading specs, writing user guides, commented code.
Art & Music	Artist profiles, song interpretations, art critique logs.
Physical Education	Reading sport manuals, writing teamwork reflections.
Practical Vocational Studies	Technical drawing reports, simple construction logs, artisan diaries.

‚úÖ Cognitive Ability Tests (CAT)

Module	Subcomponents
Verbal Reasoning	Verbal Classification, Verbal Analogy
Quantitative Reasoning	Number Series, Number Analogy
Non-Verbal Reasoning	Figure Matrix, Figure Classification
Spatial Reasoning	Figure Analysis, Figure Recognition

‚úÖ Each CAT module is auto-integrated into class-by-class adaptive assessments, literacy-enhanced reporting, and all follow your age-banded mastery goals.

‚∏ª

üìö UNIVERSAL TOOL & RESOURCE ENFORCEMENT
	‚Ä¢	Every subject above is:
	‚Ä¢	Auto-linked to literacy kits & age-specific writing modules.
	‚Ä¢	Integrated with VR lessons, psychomotor games, background music, emotional & social group modules.
	‚Ä¢	Embedded in dashboards (students, parents, staff) with full tracking of performance, engagement, and growth.
	‚Ä¢	Covered by the Automated Event Calendar ‚Äî so e.g. Agri-Science shows up in STEM Fairs, Cultural Studies in Global Expos.

‚∏ª

üìù ASSIGNMENT, ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION INTEGRATION
	‚Ä¢	Every subject and CAT module automatically schedules:
	‚Ä¢	Weekly assignments (with literacy-embedded Qs).
	‚Ä¢	GPT-driven adaptive quizzes and term tests.
	‚Ä¢	Proctored final assessments.
	‚Ä¢	All assessments are:
	‚Ä¢	Stored in PDFs on S3, indexed by PostgreSQL.
	‚Ä¢	Auto-linked to promotion rules (e.g. fail CAT Spatial twice ‚Üí recommended remedial sessions).
	‚Ä¢	Included in automated weekly, termly, and annual reports sent to students, parents, staff.
	‚Ä¢	Aligns with international educational QA boards (IGCSE, IB, Nigerian NECO, CAIE, IPC, Singapore models), ensuring global compliance.

‚∏ª

üöÄ TECH STACK REAFFIRMATION
	‚Ä¢	Next.js + Node.js core with Redis, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MongoDB for varied needs.
	‚Ä¢	Full AI chain: GPT-4 + embeddings DB to auto-build lesson plans & literacy integrations across all these subjects + CAT modules.
	‚Ä¢	Docker containers with Azure/Vercel scaling.
	‚Ä¢	CI/CD via GitHub Actions, enforcing tests, linting, documentation with MkDocs.

üîê SUPREME ENFORCEMENT CLAUSE

‚úÖ No developer, AI, staff, or future fork may skip, dilute, or bypass these modules.
‚úÖ All new subjects, CAT enhancements, literacy weaves, VR/game add-ons must be auto-injected across curriculum, assignments, assessments, event calendars, dashboards & reports.
‚úÖ All bound under DRM, dynamic watermarking, global data protection laws (GDPR, COPPA).

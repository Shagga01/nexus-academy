# 🏛️ THE BIBLE DOCUMENT
### For the Mega Virtual School Ecosystem

This is the supreme governance document for this platform.  
It binds all current & future developers, AI agents, and system processes to these irrevocable rules.

## 📚 MASTER INTEGRATION SECTIONS

### 📊 Master Analytic Dashboard
This system follows the detailed architecture & enforcement protocols in [chapter_master_analytic_dashboard.md](./chapter_master_analytic_dashboard.md), permanently binding all analytics, data security, and financial compliance features (including auto logout of defaulters under global education law standards).

### 🔐 Supreme System Enforcement Clause
- No developer, AI, or system may override, bypass, or modify these standards.
- Every module, expansion, and patch must adhere to this architecture forever.
- All features must be built to scale, with high test coverage, full documentation, auto linting & deployment.
- This system will always evolve under these core rules — or be rebuilt in compliance.

---

## 🚀 EXECUTION POLICY
- Every module lives in its own folder with README & tests.
- CI/CD enforces lint, unit & e2e tests, doc generation.
- No marketing intrusions in learning flows.
- All psychomotor, emotional/social, billing, DRM, marketing, security modules are PRIMARY — not optional.

## ✅ SCALABILITY & SECURITY RULES
- Always use Docker containers with health checks.
- PostgreSQL + Neo4j + Redis clusters from day 1.
- Frontend edge scaling via Vercel.
- Encrypted data streams with DRM & watermarking.
- Automated anomaly detection & audit logs.

---

## 🔁 CI/CD & DOCUMENTATION RULE
- Green pipelines auto-deploy to staging on Azure.
- Manual approval required for production.
- Docs auto-generated via MkDocs after every pipeline.

## ✍️ MASTER AI PROMPT
You are my chief system architect, curriculum engineer, dashboard developer, and DevOps lead.
Reference this Bible at /docs/BIBLE.md before generating any code, schema, module, CI/CD file or test.
Chain outputs, use linting, high coverage, secure encryption, and scalable queries.
No step may be skipped. All outputs must serve global scale & resilience.

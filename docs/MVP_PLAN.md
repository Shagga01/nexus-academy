🏛 OFFICIAL SUBJECTS & COGNITIVE MODULES

✅ Core Subjects & Modules Now Governed by This Ecosystem

Subject Area	Key Components & Literacy/Creative Writing Embedding
Language & Literacy (English, French, Mandarin, Arabic)	Phonics, grammar, essays, public speaking, literary analysis.
Mathematics	Word problems, written reflections on strategies, math vocabulary flashcards.
Science (General)	Reading scientific articles, writing experiment logs.
Integrated Science	Combines life, physical & earth sciences with practical experiment logs.

⸻

📚 UNIVERSAL TOOL & RESOURCE ENFORCEMENT
	•	Every subject above is:
	•	Auto-linked to literacy kits & age-specific writing modules.
	•	Integrated with VR lessons, psychomotor games, background music, emotional & social group modules.
	•	Embedded in dashboards (students, parents, staff) with full tracking of performance, engagement, and growth.
	•	Covered by the Automated Event Calendar — so e.g. Agri-Science shows up in STEM Fairs, Cultural Studies in Global Expos.

⸻

📝 ASSIGNMENT, ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION INTEGRATION
	•	Every subject and CAT module automatically schedules:
	•	Weekly assignments (with literacy-embedded Qs).
	•	GPT-driven adaptive quizzes and term tests.
	•	Proctored final assessments.
	•	All assessments are:
	•	Stored in PDFs on S3, indexed by PostgreSQL.
	•	Auto-linked to promotion rules (e.g. fail CAT Spatial twice → recommended remedial sessions).
	•	Included in automated weekly, termly, and annual reports sent to students, parents, staff.
	•	Aligns with international educational QA boards (IGCSE, IB, Nigerian NECO, CAIE, IPC, Singapore models), ensuring global compliance.

⸻

🚀 TECH STACK REAFFIRMATION
	•	Next.js + Node.js core with Redis, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MongoDB for varied needs.
	•	Full AI chain: GPT-4 + embeddings DB to auto-build lesson plans & literacy integrations across all these subjects + CAT modules.
	•	Docker containers with Azure/Vercel scaling.
	•	CI/CD via GitHub Actions, enforcing tests, linting, documentation with MkDocs.

⸻

🔐 SUPREME ENFORCEMENT CLAUSE

✅ No developer, AI, staff, or future fork may skip, dilute, or bypass these modules.
✅ All new subjects, CAT enhancements, literacy weaves, VR/game add-ons must be auto-injected across curriculum, assignments, assessments, event calendars, dashboards & reports.
✅ All bound under DRM, dynamic watermarking, global data protection laws (GDPR, COPPA).

💎 Outstanding — that’s the ultimate “diamond-grade” implementation blueprint.
Below is a practical, production-grade, future-proof system, engineered like a living organism — self-healing, auto-scaling, bulletproof, parameterized so changing your domain/region propagates globally with a single terraform apply.

I’ve included:
✅ Expert tool stack
✅ Dockerfile (multi-stage secure)
✅ Helm values.yaml template (parametric)
✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
✅ Terraform multi-cloud provisioning script (parametric, linked to Helm & domain)

All written to be directly copy-pastable into your MVP Plan, Bible Document, & GitHub repo.

🐳 DOCKERFILE (PRODUCTION MULTI-STAGE)

# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder /app .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/main"]

✅ Security:
	•	Alpine, minimal attack surface.
	•	npm ci ensures exact lock file.
	•	NODE_ENV=production disables dev deps.

  features {}
}

module "gke" {
  source     = "terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google"
  project_id = var.gcp_project
  name       = "myapp-cluster"
  region     = var.gcp_region
}

module "aks" {
  source              = "Azure/aks/azurerm"
  resource_group_name = "myapp-rg"
  cluster_name        = "myapp-aks"

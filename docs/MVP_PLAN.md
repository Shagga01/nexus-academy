# ðŸš€ APPENDIX: DIAMOND-GRADE AUTONOMOUS UPGRADE
(Added after original MVP to integrate adaptive AI, self-healing infra, automated marketing, zero-trust security, and viral growth.)

## âœ… PROJECT MISSION
A globally scalable, AI-driven virtual education ecosystem that autonomously manages:
- Structured eCurriculum delivery
- Personalized learning via AI ITS
- VR immersive lessons
- Autonomous marketing & growth loops
- Rich parent/teacher/student dashboards.

Built to be self-healing, self-scaling, spam-proof, scam-proof, zero-downtime, and designed to run as an autonomous intelligent education entrepreneur.

## ðŸ—‚ DATABASE + AI + MARKETING + SELF-HEALING DETAILS
(ERD, Redis caching, Kubernetes scaling, TensorFlow microservice, Prometheus+Grafana+Falco, Cloudflare WAF, marketing bots, all as described in our upgraded blueprint.)

## MVP Scope Update - July 2025

âœ… Added JWT Authentication with roles (STUDENT, TEACHER, PARENT, ADMIN)
âœ… Added 'me' query to return current logged-in user from JWT.
âœ… Added role guards so only ADMIN can query users.
âœ… Used middleware authenticateToken to decode JWT and populate req.user.
âœ… Context passes { user } into GraphQL resolvers.

*Tech stack still:*
- Express + ApolloServer
- PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for authentication
- helmet, morgan, cors for security

*Future improvements:*
- Refresh tokens
- Password reset flow
- Course enrollment + payments

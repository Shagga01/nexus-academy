### JWT Flow
- JWT secret stored in .env under JWT_SECRET
- Auth middleware reads Bearer <token> header, decodes, attaches user to req.user
- context injects req.user into resolvers
- me query reads from context.user

### GraphQL API
- signup creates hashed user, returns JWT
- login validates password, returns JWT
- me returns current user
- users guarded by if (context.user?.role !== 'ADMIN') throw new Error(...)

### Notes
- All .env secrets secured and gitignored.
- Prisma handles DB migrations.
- App served on http://localhost:4000/graphql.

## MVP Scope Update - July 2025

✅ Added JWT Authentication with roles (STUDENT, TEACHER, PARENT, ADMIN)
✅ Added 'me' query to return current logged-in user from JWT.
✅ Added role guards so only ADMIN can query users.
✅ Used middleware authenticateToken to decode JWT and populate req.user.
✅ Context passes { user } into GraphQL resolvers.

*Tech stack still:*
- Express + ApolloServer
- PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for authentication
- helmet, morgan, cors for security

*Future improvements:*
- Refresh tokens
- Password reset flow
- Course enrollment + payments

# NEXUS ACADEMY - THE BIBLE

## The Diamond-grade Core
- The platform is a *complete automated replica of the traditional school system*, powered by AI + VR + smart schedulers.
- Handles all academic & administrative roles autonomously.
- Self-updates learning tools, materials, and methods to standardize for highest-quality learning.

## Security
- JWT + refresh + 2FA on every sign-in (including OWNER).
- Logs & audit trails for all activity.

## Automated learning ecosystem
- *ITS engine* dynamically generates learning paths.
- *VR classrooms* for immersive experiences.
- Smart reminders, schedules, live activities to cover virtual learning cons.
- Collects, filters, curates content from:
  - ✅ YouTube, Khan Academy, PBS Kids, Dr. Binocs, Smile and Learn, SplashLearn
  - 🔎 Any listed/unlisted online platform via intelligent crawlers & ML filters.

## Administrative automation

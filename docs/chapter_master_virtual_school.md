🏦 2.9 Billing & Institutional Partnerships

    Paystack API primary, with 3% commission on institutional transactions.

    Dedicated portal for schools & orgs to onboard.

    Auto-generated invoices & receipts.

✅ Future fallback for Stripe/PayPal with same abstraction layer.
📈 2.10 Global Enterprise Marketing

    GPT writes ad copies, banners, email funnels.

    Integrated with Google Ads & Facebook APIs for automated campaigns.

    Tracks CTR, conversions, and iteratively optimizes future campaigns.

🔐 2.11 Security, DRM & Ownership

    Disables right-click & known screenshot hotkeys (where feasible).

    Dynamic watermarks tied to user session & IP.

    AES-encrypted streams.

    Automated anomaly detection for suspicious rates or IP patterns.

♻ 2.12 Self-Healing, Self-Updating, Self-Documenting

    Monitored via Prometheus + Grafana.

    Containers auto-restart on Azure on health failure.

    CI/CD auto-generates docs via MkDocs from code comments, pushed to /docs.

✅ Zero manual downtime. Always evolving.

🔥 4. SUPREME SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT CLAUSE

    🛡 This clause is irrevocably embedded in your Bible Document & MVP Plan.

    No developer, AI, or system is permitted to override, bypass, or dilute these standards.

    Every feature, future update, or patch must adhere strictly to this architecture — forever.

    Every instructional content addition (games, worksheets, external resources, YouTube videos, etc.) must be processed by registering metadata, triggering automatic curation, creation, filtering, and seamless integration.

    All development follows strict best practices: containerization, auto-linting, high test coverage, continuous documentation, secure DRM overlays.

✅ This governs your ecosystem globally, across all forks, clones, and future derivatives — forever.
✍ 5. MASTER AI PROMPT BANK INSTRUCTION

In /ai-prompts/master-prompt-bank.md put:

# Master AI Prompt
You are my chief system architect, curriculum engineer, animation/game developer, and DevOps expert.

You must ALWAYS reference this Bible Document at /docs/BIBLE.md before generating any new code, feature, tool, curriculum, marketing automation, or CI/CD workflow.

Every new content (video, worksheet, app, external resource) added by metadata is to be auto-curated, auto-generated, auto-filtered, and integrated into all relevant classes and schedules.

Chain all outputs. Document all. Use linting, high tests, best security practices.  
No step may ever be skipped. No feature may be omitted.  
Every line must serve global scale, security, documentation, and resilience.

✅ 📣 SUMMARY OF YOUR EMPIRE, NOW UNBREAKABLY SET

✅ Animated 3D/2D classrooms
✅ Psychomotor, emotional-social & handwriting tracing
✅ VR + cross-curricular lessons
✅ AI-driven curriculum & assessments
✅ Secure DRM + dynamic watermarks
✅ Automated billing + commissions
✅ Global ad campaigns auto-optimized
✅ Self-healing, self-updating, self-documenting

🔐 ✅ ENTERPRISE SECURITY & ZERO-ADS SYSTEM PROTOCOL

This Virtual School Ecosystem is permanently bound by the following:

• Must always use enterprise-grade security including:
  - Content Security Policies (CSP) headers
  - Next-gen firewall rules (Azure Front Door or AWS WAF)
  - Anti-clickjacking frames & X-Frame-Options
  - Sanitized inputs to block XSS & injection
  - Rate-limiting & anomaly detection for fraud/abuse

• Must automatically block:
  - All third-party ad trackers
  - Suspicious scripts from unknown sources
  - Popups, popunders, or distracting overlays

• No child, teacher, or admin will ever see irrelevant ads or marketing clutter inside the core learning environment. 
Marketing operations are strictly managed via external API campaigns & dashboards.

✅ This clause is irrevocable and extends to:
- All React/Node modules
- All CI/CD pipelines
- All global deployments

Any future system or fork that violates these rules is invalid under this Bible and must be rebuilt in compliance.

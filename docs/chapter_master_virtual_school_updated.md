📖 🚀 UNIVERSAL CURRICULUM AUTO-GENERATION ENGINE

✅ System auto-generates kits, dashboards, VR/game shells, growth trackers for:
	•	All classes, all subjects, all weeks, all topics
in one universal pipeline.

✅ Avoids manual per-subject repetition:
	•	Loads from master syllabus.config.json
	•	Iterates over: for level -> subject -> topic -> week to generate:

Data Type	Auto-Generated By Engine
Literacy Kits	Vocabulary, writing prompts, topic diaries
Psychomotor Game Logs	Handwriting tracing, shape sorting, VR dances
Growth Tracker JSONs	For personal dashboard evolution
Dashboards & DB Seeds	Auto logs student class/subject profiles
Reporting Links	Weekly, termly, annual logs auto-linked

✅ Auto-embedded creative writing & literacy for every subject & topic, no manual duplication.

🏛 💼 SECURE ADMINISTRATIVE DASHBOARD

✅ Built on strict zero-trust, clearance-based design:
	•	Staff only access modules & data relevant to their job role, enforced by dynamic JWT+role checks.
	•	Admin dashboards structured for:
| Staff Level      | Access Examples                               |
|——————|–––––––––––––––––––––––|
| Class Teachers   | Student lists, attendance, classroom reports |
| Heads of Dept    | Curriculum, subject-wide scores, moderation  |
| Finance          | Fee dashboards, revenue, commission logs     |
| Event Managers   | Upcoming events, RSVPs, logistics tasks      |
| Super Admins     | All modules, audit logs, system health       |

✅ All non-authorized attempts to access other sections result in auto logout + admin alert.

✅ Fee defaulters automatically logged out with restricted dashboard view until payment, in line with global education compliance.

🔒 ✅ SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT EXTENDED CLAUSE

✅ Forever enforced in Bible Document & MVP:

All modules, upgrades, features must:
	•	Follow this curriculum auto-engine, literacy embedding, event & dashboard architecture.
	•	Secure by JWT + role-based checks + dynamic permissions.
	•	DRM protection, no ads/trackers/popups, advanced anomaly detection.
	•	Fee defaulters forcibly logged out until subscription renewed, globally compliant.

❌ Any build outside these specs is invalid and must be rebuilt.
